# About

**dcss-ai-wrapper** is an API for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup for Artificial Intelligence research. This effort started with the following paper:

# Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](https://dcss-ai-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/quickstart.html) instructions on the documentation webpage.

# Quickest way to use API 

Example usage to create your own agent and run it:

```python
from dcss.agent.base import BaseAgent
from dcss.state.game import GameState
from dcss.actions.action import Action
from dcss.websockgame import WebSockGame
from dcss.connection.config import WebserverConfig

import random

class MyAgent(BaseAgent):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.gamestate = None

    def get_action(self, gamestate: GameState):
        self.gamestate = gamestate
        # get all possible actions
        actions = Action.get_all_move_commands()
        # call your planner or policy instead of random: 
        return random.choice(actions)

def main():
    my_config = WebserverConfig

    # set game mode to Tutorial #1
    my_config.game_id = 'tut-web-trunk'
    my_config.tutorial_number = 1

    # create game
    game = WebSockGame(config=my_config,
                      agent_class=MyAgent)
    game.run()
```

# Contribute

- The most recent branch is the `master` branch. 

- The current goal is to enable the API to support every DCSS action and level (except ABYSS, LABRYNTH levels, we'll worry about those later). The _humaninterfaceagent_ is an agent that accepts keyboard input from a human. We are using this to test the API by playing DCSS. A great way to help contribute is to play the game and post any errors you get when playing as new git issues!

- Please feel free to look at existing issues and submit a PR.

- We welcome any and all questions on the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dcss-ai-wrapper/community).

- We expect to publish academic papers as we meet more milestones. If you contribute to the development of the project, we would like to include you as an author. 

# Building the documentation

Make sure the library is installed or autodoc may complain:

    python
    >>> import dcss

If you get a module not found error, install locally, for example:

    cd dcss-ai-wrapper/
    python -m pip install -e .

#### Option 1:

Build the api documentation by:

    sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/api/ src/dcss/

On windows, use the make.bat script to create the html files:

    .\docs\make.bat html
    
Then open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser to view the documentation.

##### If getting errors when building docs

Try two things: (1) make clean, like:

    .\docs\make.bat clean

and also remove all files in the `docs/api/` folder before doing

    sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/api/ src/dcss/

and then finally run make to generate the html

    .\docs\make.bat html


#### Option 2:

Use sphinx-build from the root project directory like:

    sphinx-build  -v -b html docs/ docs/_build


If getting the following error:

    sphinx.errors.ExtensionError: Could not import extension autoapi.extension (exception: No module named 'autoapi')
    
then you may need to install autoapi like:

    pip install sphinx-autoapi
